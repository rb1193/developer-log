Secondly, when you order a fixed price, fixed scope project from a software development agency and it has been delivered as agreed, you can be sure of one of these three things:

- You have overpaid because the agency is good at estimating and considering the risk of the unknown, so they could keep the quality at a good level and still made a lot of money on that.
- You have underpaid, and although the project will be delivered in full within the budget/time, you will have to pay a lot for fixing the quality later on.
- The agency is incompetent and/or inexperienced. They priced the project below the actual budget needed, but as they are ambitious in terms of the quality, they will deliver decent quality and cover the extra costs with their savings. Hurray, you are the winner, they are the losers. Well, you won this time, at least. If you need any additional development, you will probably need to look for it somewhere else or be prepared to pay a lot more than you got away with this time.
